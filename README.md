# Project Summary

Project Objectives
Increase Client Reach and Engagement: The goal was to analyze social media data to uncover patterns and trends that could be leveraged to boost client engagement and reach.

Gain Valuable Insights for Improving Social Media Performance: We aimed to extract actionable insights from the data that would guide the optimization of social media strategies.

Achieve Social Media Goals with Data-Driven Recommendations: The analysis was intended to provide clear, evidence-based recommendations that would help clients achieve their social media objectives.

Process and Methodology

# Data Collection and Cleaning:

We started with a dataset of social media posts that included sentiment labels, timestamps, and text content. (Download the dataset here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140, too big to be attached)

The dataset was cleaned by removing unnecessary columns, handling missing data, and standardizing the text to facilitate analysis.
Special attention was given to preserving the date column to enable temporal analysis.
Sentiment Analysis Over Time:

By analyzing sentiment trends over time, we were able to identify patterns that could be linked to specific events or content strategies.
The sentiment trend analysis revealed fluctuations in public sentiment that could inform the timing of future social media campaigns.

# Predictive Modeling:

We developed and tested several models to predict the sentiment of social media posts, starting with a logistic regression model and progressing to more complex models.

Hyperparameter tuning was applied to optimize the logistic regression model, but the performance remained consistent with an accuracy of 0.77.

We then explored word embeddings to capture semantic information more effectively, but the performance was comparable to the initial model.

Finally, we implemented a deep learning model using LSTM, which achieved a significant improvement with an accuracy of 0.82.

# Key Insights and Takeaways:

Model Performance: The LSTM model provided the best performance, indicating that sequential information in text is crucial for sentiment prediction.

Sentiment Trends: The analysis of sentiment over time highlighted the importance of monitoring public sentiment continuously to adapt strategies proactively.

Actionable Insights: The ability to predict sentiment accurately allows for the timely adjustment of content strategies, ensuring that posts align with audience sentiment.

# Challenges and Solutions:

Data Representation: One challenge was effectively representing text data for model consumption. We experimented with TF-IDF, word embeddings, and deep learning, ultimately finding that LSTM offered the best results.(Download the pre-trained model here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leadbest/googlenewsvectorsnegative300)

I recommend using a pre-trained model, you can also trained your model using the data-set.

Binary Classification: The original dataset had more than two sentiment classes, requiring conversion to a binary format for consistency in modeling.

# Achieving Project Objectives

Increasing Client Reach and Engagement:

The sentiment analysis and predictive modeling efforts provide a foundation for crafting content that resonates with the audience, leading to increased engagement.
By identifying optimal posting times and content types through sentiment trends, clients can better target their audience.

# Gaining Valuable Insights:

The analysis provided deep insights into how different types of content and timing affect audience sentiment, enabling more informed decision-making.
The predictive models allow for real-time sentiment assessment, helping clients adjust their strategies on the fly.

# Achieving Social Media Goals with Data-Driven Recommendations:

The findings from this project empower clients to achieve their social media goals by leveraging data to guide their content strategies.

The LSTM model, with its higher accuracy, can be integrated into real-time analytics platforms, providing continuous feedback on content performance.

# Conclusion

The project successfully met its objectives by employing advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques to uncover insights and optimize social media strategies. The use of LSTM models for sentiment analysis proved to be the most effective approach, yielding an accuracy of 0.82. These insights and tools will enable clients to enhance their social media presence, increase engagement, and achieve their business goals through data-driven strategies.
